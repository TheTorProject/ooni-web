# Publishing

Make sure you have the ghpage remote setup with:

```
make setup
```

That runs:

```
git remote add ghpage git@github.com:ooni/ooni.github.io.git
```

You can publish the website to github by running:

```
make publish
```

Once this is done you can then update the site on the torproject server by
doing:

```
make update-site
```

If you want to do both at the same time run:

```
make publish-update
```
