We are happy to announce the public pre-release of ooniprobe 2.0.0 and
lepidopter beta.

One of the most important new features that these releases have is an intuitive
graphical interface that a user can launch and interact within a web browser.

You can run and use ooniprobe by following the [installation instructions]
(https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2).

Note that currently the pre-release is only available for Linux OSes.

If you have a Raspberry Pi device you can copy the image to an SD card, plug
Raspberry Pi to a network and start using the ooniprobe's graphical interface
in your favorite web browser. You can find detailed instructions on how to go
through the installation process and access ooniprobe's graphical interface
[here](https://ooni.torproject.org/install/lepidopter/)

When you first visit ooniprobe web interface (in your web browser) you should
be greeted by the setup wizard:

You will need to go through the setup wizard, read the risks involved with
running ooniprobe and answer go through a fast quiz --we promise it will not
take long. Once you have successfully answered the quiz questions you will be
redirected to the customization page where you can configure (if you prefer)
ooniprobe. Finally you will be greeted by ooniprobe's web interface similar to
this:

You are ready, thank you for running ooniprobe!
