**Country:** Brazil, worldwide

**OONI tests:** [Web Connectivity](https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/web-connectivity/),
[HTTP requests](https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/http-requests/)

**Probed ISPs:** AS1916 (Associação Rede Nacional de Ensino e Pesquisa),

Filial Distrito Federal)

**Measurement period:** July 2016 — November 2017

**Website inaccessibility reasons:** IPv6 or DNSSEC misconfiguration

We ecently identifyed DNS based networking interferences after
inaccessibility of the website [pernambuco.com](http://pernambuco.com); a
regional news portal in Brazil that is not reachable from several networks and
ISPs in Brazil [for quite a long
time](https://people.torproject.org/~andz/pe/measurements.br.pernambuco.pdf).
Looking at the OONI data we found that the website was not reachable
and it seemed as a [DNS-based
blocking](https://explorer.ooni.torproject.org/measurement/s3YPvS70pxtUQXG5qLv8z2wfafZ98eUzCmxcbYkvSRELpYS2mBWksZCacvAr5GqS?input=http:%2F%2Fwww.pernambuco.com%2Fdiario).
due to empty DNS responses that is usually a sign of possible internet censorship
or network blocking. Upon further analysis we detected a number of DNS
misconfigurations of the upstream's provider (UPX) DNS servers were the
nameservers of the domain in question are hosted. A
[nameserver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server) is a necessary
component and the most important function of a DNS server that implements a
network service for providing responses to queries against a directory service.
In this article we present an analysis of possible DNS misconfigurations that
may have caused the website to be inaccessible and provide some possible
solution to resolve DNS misconfiguration that cause `pernambuco.com` and other
affected websites to be inaccessible in Brazil and other networks worldwide.

(FIXME: what version of assets in people/~andz should we store in static/post/xxxx?)

OONI tries hard to apply Hanlon's razor to every statement about network
interference: *never attribute to censorship that which is adequately explained
by misconfiguration*. Thanks to Lucas from CodingRights that gave us access to
his networks, the numerous OONI measurements reports that were submitted by
volunteers and RIPE Atlas measurements we were able to investigate the DNS
interference issues that made not possible to access the regional news portal
[pernambuco.com](http://pernambuco.com) from within various ISPs and networks
in Brazil as well as worldwide.

## DNS resolution failures

The basic issue we have identified was the [recursive DNS nameserver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Recursive_and_caching_name_server)
provided by [Virtua ISP](https://stat.ripe.net/AS28573) failed to resolve the
domain responding with <tt>SERVFAIL</tt> (Server failure) that means the name
server was unable to process the query due to a problem with the name
server (Source: [RFC1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035))

Below the output of the DNS lookup utility `dig` querying the domain name
`pernambuco.com`:

</details>

One of the ways to check if the domain is blocked by some local DNS policy is
an attempt to resolve it directly through [authoritative nameserver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Authoritative_name_server).
If DNS name resolution works that way it suggests that the case could be some
misconfiguration and not a DNS-based filtering. And `pernambuco.com` domain was
passing the test:

While checking various resolution paths we discovered that `ns2.upx.com.br`
resolving to the IPv6 address `2001:19f0:ac01:b3:5400:ff:fe46:4676` was not
responding to DNS queries. The first assumption we made was that the recursive
DNS nameserver has a strong preference to IPv6 over IPv4 and fails fast if the
IPv6 endpoint  is not reachable. However the resource `ns1.upx.com.br` had an
IPv6 address, so we assumed that there is something special about the resource
`ns2.upx.com.br` and found out that it was the only authoritative nameserver
having an IPv6
[glue record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Circular_dependencies_and_glue_records)
in the top-level domain zone.

We verified through RIPE Atlas measurements that `ns2.upx.com.br` works without
errors through IPv4 via
[DNS/TCP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10197953/#!probes), but is broken
through IPv6 both via
[DNS/UDP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10197871/#!probes) and
[DNS/TCP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10197872/#!probes).

We got in contact with the service provider of the aforementioned DNS
nameserver [UPX Technologies](https://www.upx.com/) and reported the issue. The
technical support team was very prompt and quickly resolved the issue of the
IPv6 connectivity for
[DNS/TCP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10199076/#!probes) and
[DNS/UDP](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10199080/#!probes). We appreciate
the level of cooperation and support from the UPX team, even if we are not
their customers.

Unfortunately the recursive DNS nameserver still responds with the
<tt>SERVFAIL</tt> error code and the issue [affects lots of Brazilian
networks](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10203306/#!probes), although not
all of them: and this is an indicator that it *may* be a possible
misconfiguration and not a network filtering policy. In point of fact, the
issue is affecting a number of
[networks worldwide](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10203314/#!probes) and
the [failure was cached](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10204036/#!probes)
according to consequent resolution latency. The issue seems to be "persistent"
as is unlikely that IP routing is the root cause. In addition to the domain
`pernambuco.com` there are other affected domains such as [`aquipe.com.br`]
(https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10204359/#!probes) presenting the same
failure and symptoms. But some other domains "hosted" by UPX Technologies were
not affected, and [`dpnet.com.br` was one of properly working
domains](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10204294/#!probes).  as well as
the resource `upx.com.br` hosted on the same nameservers has [no issues related
to the  DNS resolving](https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/10203916/#!general)
from the same vantage points.
What is common between the failing domains (SERVFAIL response code) is the
difference between the `NS` records at the top-level domain nameserver and the
authoritative nameserver that was clearly visible in the tracing of the
delegation path from the root name servers; `dig +trace`.

## NS records pointing to a CNAME is a bad practice

The `NS` records of the affected domains are `americadonorte.upx.com.br` and
`americalatina.upx.com.br` were these records are `CNAME` records in the
`upx.com.br` zone and according to [RFC's 1996 common DNS errors
section](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1912#section-2.4) (dating back around
11 years ago): "*Having NS records pointing to a CNAME is bad and may conflict
badly with current BIND servers. In fact, current BIND implementations will
ignore such records, possibly leading to a lame delegation*".
A proof of concept to verify this issue in the most widely used DNS server,
[BIND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND) follows:

## Workaround

A list of possible ways to fix this issue:

- UPX may expand americalatina.upx.com.br and americadonorte.upx.com.br CNAMEs to usual `A` and `AAAA` records
- The administrator of the affected website may change americalatina.upx.com.br to ns1.upx.com.br and ns2.upx.com.br in corresponding TLD registry control panel

## Responsible disclosure

On the 15th of November 2017 we have reported to UPX the issue along with a way
to reproduce it and have still not received any reply on a possible resolution.
Our intention is for UPX to solve the issue for all UPX customers instead of
customers manually changing the NS records of their domains in the top-level
domain registry.

We believe that the issue is indeed a misconfiguration and not an intention
network interference from network filtering policy. We hope that our report may
help other people or entities to troubleshoot and fix DNS misconfiguration that
may affect the accessibility of a website.
