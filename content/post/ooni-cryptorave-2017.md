[CryptoRave](https://cryptorave.org/) is a free, non-commercial and
collectively funded 48 hour event featuring talks, workshops and activities
related to security, privacy, anonymity, hacking and freedom of expression that
attracts more that 2,500 people mainly from South America. The event took place
in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil on 5th and 6th May 2017.

A number of people attended the OONI
[presentation](https://cpa.cryptorave.org/pt-BR/CR2017/public/events/43) and
[workshop](https://cpa.cryptorave.org/pt-BR/CR2017/public/events/112)
("Listatona") that was co-organized with [Coding Rights](https://www.codingrights.org/).
During the workshop participants were able to
better understand OONI's testing methodology, and how OONI Probe performs
network measurements. Participants provided useful feedback regarding
[test-lists](https://ooni.org/get-involved/contribute-test-lists/)
and URLs from diverse sources from South America.

Below we provide the OONI presentation slides in English and Portuguese.
